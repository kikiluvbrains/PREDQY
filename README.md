# PREDQY
This software can predict the PLQY after giving it two ligands in the form of smile string. 

# PLQY Predictor

## Overview
The PLQY Predictor is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to input two SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings and get a prediction of the Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY).

## Prerequisites
Before running the PLQY Predictor, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- (Optional) A virtual environment manager like `conda` or `venv`

## Installation

### Using pip
First, clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine. Then navigate to the root directory of the application and install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
